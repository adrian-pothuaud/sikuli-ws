Image Library
=============

Image Library is an external folder to save and organize images for Sikuli scripts.

Image Library folders can be added to Sikuli scripts with:

    addImagePath(path) # add a path to image path

or using src/path_utils.sikuli

    path_utils.add_image_path() # safely add a path to image path
